Special thanks to JasonSpatial for the incredible help and generosity shown in creating this amazing learning community and opportunity to explore and develop XR applications in Unity! Thank you as well to all of my fellow XRgonauts who have inspired me with their kindness and courage, I am really looking forward to continuing this epic quest with everyone and to see all of our ideas come to life in Unity! =)
